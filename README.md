Main work content:

1. Construction of multi-posture palmprint database: Building a database containing palmprint images in multiple postures is the basis of the research. This work involves collecting palmprint images of different users in different postures, including but not limited to rotation, tilt and different degrees of pitch angles of the palm. The construction of the database needs to ensure the diversity and representativeness of the samples so that the algorithm can be effectively trained and tested in a variety of practical scenarios.
2. Research on multi-posture palmprint region of interest extraction algorithm: Research on how to accurately extract the region of interest (ROI) from multi-posture palmprint images. This includes developing algorithms to identify the key feature points of palmprints, such as lines, bifurcation points and end points, and determining ROI on this basis. The goal of this work is to improve the adaptability and recognition accuracy of the algorithm for palmprint images in different postures.
3. Research on multi-posture palmprint region of interest correction algorithm: Develop a correction algorithm to correct image distortion caused by changes in palm posture. This work involves image processing and pattern recognition technology, and the purpose is to correct palmprint images in different postures to a standard posture for more accurate feature comparison and recognition. The correction algorithm needs to be able to handle issues such as rotation, scaling, and deformation of the image to ensure the robustness of the recognition system.
